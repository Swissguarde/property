## Property Listing Platform

This project is a **property listing platform** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, and **NextAuth**. It allows users to **list** and **rent, properties**, offering features such as:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and account management via **NextAuth**.
- **Property Listings**: Users can create and manage detailed property listings, including images, pricing, amenities, and more.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Integrated messaging system for communication between property owners and potential buyers/renters.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Efficient image upload and storage for property images.

The platform aims to streamline property management and provide a seamless user experience for both sellers and buyers.

## Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
